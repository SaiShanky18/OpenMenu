All entrees were delicious!\n\nThe gyro meat was cooked to perfection with and seasoned mildly with a balance of spices.  Its profile hinted at a predominant beef composition. The accompanying tzatziki sauce, while light in texture, offered a burst of fresh, vibrant flavor. This dish combination of seasoned meat and tangy sauce always makes for a wonderful dining experience.  It's a dish worth returning for for sure.\n\nThe accompanying Greek salad, with a balsamic sauce, was fresh and crisp. The chicken strips were tender breast meat with perfectly light and crispy breading. The burger and fries were generous portions.",

The service is quick. Seating present outside and inside. I particularly enjoyed their spanakopita, dolmades and the falafel. The gyro plate was ok. They didn't have a working bathroom so we ended up using one in the restaurant next door. This is a solid option for food. Not much ambiance wise.",

        "text": "I ordered a Gyro combo (Gyro and salad). Cost about $15.\n\nFood was 3/5 aka average. It was decent for the price. I’ve had gyros from all over the country and I kept help but feel that the Tzatziki sauce was lacking in flavor a tad bit. I was kind of sad about it as that’s my favorite part.\n\nLoved the side salad with the Greek balsamic dressing. The veggies were fresh and crunchy. The dressing kind of saved the gyro for me when I added the dressing to it.\n\nGood portions for the price. Which is why they got 4 stars instead of 3.\n\nThe atmosphere is good too, they had Rush Hour playing on the tv so it was a vibe. Good customer service, the employees there were nice and the place was clean. It is a small space however, but it was fine for me as I dined alone. Would be a nice place to grab lunch during a lunch break at work.",

The crust has that perfect balance of crispy and chewy, and they’ve got plenty of topping options to mix things up. The atmosphere is laid-back and casual, making it great for a quick bite after classes or a night out. Service is fast, prices are fair, and you definitely won’t leave hungry. A true Midtown staple!",

The garlic knots were delicious with marinara sauce.. overall take your chance and try other items on the menu here. I wouldn’t go for the pizza again since I like my crust to be crunchy and not watery/loose. Thanks.🌱",

Over the past two months, I have spent close to $250 on Tin Drum. The food is the BEST Asian I have had in Atlanta in two years. Hands down. The ramen with pork belly, Singaporean curry noodles, and most of all, Chinese-Mongolian stir fry with pork belly and mushrooms are incredible. With the brown sugar milk tea, Thai tea, or pineapple peach tea, it physically hurts me when I go a week without eating their food. Don’t be afraid to try their fried chicken sandwich and crinkle fries — better than any burger and fries I’ve had in a long, long time. Been hooked since the first time. Can’t describe how good the food is, only my photo album filled with Tin Drum can. The service is so fast, employees so nice, restaurant so clean, and energy both peace and alive. With only $10-15 per bowl, it is one of the cheapest options for good quality food out here. As a food loving Tech student, I’ve been to all Tech Square restaurants, but none of them compares to Tin Drum. Tin Drum isn’t just a restaurant— it’s a way of life. It’s my safe haven. It’s my home.",

They serve everything from ramen and lo mein to panang curry and creative boba. A favorite: the chicken lettuce wraps and chicken lo mein are both reliably delicious  .\n\nThe menu offers a great variety of Pan-Asian dishes, all cooked fresh and customizable too—ideal when you're on-the-go or craving something different  . Many reviews highlight friendly service, consistent quality, and the quick pace—even referring to it as a “safe haven” and a “home” for students  .\n\nA perfect choice for a satisfying, fast, and flavorful meal right in the heart of Tech Square.",

The ladies behind the register saw us standing in line and didn’t bother to tend to us for 10 minutes. She then explained that they do not have cashiers and that you order on the tablet. That would have been helpful to know. The food and drinks were delicious I wish they had one in my town. The service was not good but I think once you know how to order and that the “waitresses” are motivated there to assist then you will be ok. We did not wait long for the food. The drinks with some sort of bubbles were exceptional!!",

The paneer veggie bowl taste delicious too. Loved the crunchy peas on the top, very creative bowl menu. The mango lassi taste delicious 🤤 though couldn’t taste cardamom in it which was mentioned in the ingredients list. I’d recommend this place to everyone. 🌱",

The portion sizes are also significantly smaller given that the place serves predominantly college students. Before they were stingy with just the protein but now so little curry and even so little toppings ... I feel like I'm eating just rice now. Looks like I need to find another go-to spot to eat :((",

Although I only tried their incredible wings and fried rice, I was blown away by the flavors and the quality of the food.\n\nThe wings were nothing short of fantastic—crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, with just the right amount of seasoning. They were definitely one of the best I’ve ever had! The fried rice complemented the wings perfectly, bursting with flavor and freshness. It was clear that a lot of care goes into their food preparation.\n\nEven though I only sampled a couple of items from the menu, I have no doubt that everything else at Fry & Fork is equally excellent. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, making it a wonderful place to enjoy a meal.\n\nI can’t wait to return for lunch and explore more of their menu. If you’re looking for a great dining experience, I highly recommend Fry & Fork! You won’t be disappointed.",

The breading was cooked to perfection. Nicely seasoned all for a reasonable price. Another thing I noticed was that the owner was there watching interactions and customer satisfaction. I didn’t know who he was until I left but I love to see owners taking an active role in their business and getting feedback from customers. He made sure to ask how my food was and to made sure I had everything I needed. Will be back.",

Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside - just what you want. Plus, the bun wasn't all bready and heavy, which kept things nice and balanced.\n\nThe fries (wedge style, FYI) were also crispy and perfect for dipping. And let's not forget the staff - super friendly and helpful!\n\nHonestly, I can't wait to go back and try something else. Fry & Fork totally blew my taste buds away!",

I got full from the chicken outside of the bun in the container. Cheese so gooey. I didnt get the onions and peppers. I believe it is all white meat chicken. It was grilled and juicy. The bun could barely hold the chicken and cheese. Steak fries were good. I will definitely try this place again next time I'm in Atlanta.",

The restaurant’s elegant, contemporary décor creates a cozy ambiance that makes it great for both a quick meal or a laid-back dinner outing. Many diners rave about the \"awesome\" food, calling the spot a \"must‑eat in town\" with “fabulous food & flawless service” and “speechless” performance overall.  The menu blends sushi, hibachi, and classic Chinese dishes, and many reviewers on delivery platforms praise the sushi—especially rolls like the Atlanta Roll and spicy tuna—as consistently fresh and flavorful.  It’s a go-to for those craving variety, quality, and a relaxed Tech Square dining vibe.",

Called the manager, he said there is nothing wrong with it. lol. ok! What a shame.\n\nPost owner response: Trust me, this sushi was like wet garbage. I have no problem with 'value' sushi.

I ordered a Garlic Soy Chicken lunch special and the drink was a Crème Brûlée Milk Tea. The chicken was serviceable, but not as memorable as the standalone chicken shops I’ve tried before  .\n\nThe bubble tea was the highlight: smooth, rich, and packed with flavor. Their menu is impressively varied, featuring options like Cheese Foam Tea, Fruit Yakult, Tofu Pudding, and Coconut Slush that make browsing fun  . But even though the drinks are solid, the dining area and overall setup feel more functional than vibe-inducing—definitely not a sit-and-chat kind of spot  .\n\nSo, it's a creative mash-up that works best if you’re really craving a quality boba and a quick bite. Just be cautious about expectations regarding the chicken side—it’s decent but not the showstopper I hoped for.",
